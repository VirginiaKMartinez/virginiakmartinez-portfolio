She is a person who learns very fast, who loves teamwork and for whom professional development is very important. Virginia is very dedicated and responsible person. I really appreciate her skill in connecting to people. I recommend her for any challenging project because she is really good at solving issues and finding the best way for each problem. It was great and enriching working with her and I wish we will work together again! I think any company wins in having a person like her on their team."

        "For years Virginia worked in the Vivocom team, which pioneered the creation, production, post-production and launch of the first Internet TV channels in Europe (and some in the world) of political parties, banks, NGOs, etc. Virginia honoured a time when there was a need for committed, highly professional, dedicated and pioneering people (creative, flexible, tireless…). If I had to hire Virginia again, I would certainly do it."
